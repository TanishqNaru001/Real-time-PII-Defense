# Project Guardian 2.0 â€“ PII Detection & Redaction Deployment Strategy

## 1. Overview
The goal is to prevent unauthorized access and leakage of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in real-time data streams. The solution should detect and redact PII from incoming and stored data with minimal latency while being scalable and cost-effective.

## 2. Deployment Architecture

### Option A: API Gateway Plugin (Recommended)
- **Placement:** At the API gateway layer, where all inbound and outbound API requests pass.
- **Function:** Intercepts requests/responses, scans JSON payloads, detects PII, and redacts it before forwarding.
- **Advantages:**
  - Centralized control across all microservices and APIs.
  - No modification required for individual services.
  - Low latency impact when optimized for regex/NER operations.
  - Easy to scale by horizontally scaling the gateway layer.

### Option B: Sidecar Container in Kubernetes
- **Placement:** Sidecar container running alongside each application pod.
- **Function:** Monitors traffic to/from the application and performs real-time PII redaction.
- **Advantages:**
  - Pod-level isolation ensures security.
  - Scales automatically with application pods.
- **Considerations:** Slight increase in resource consumption per pod.

### Option C: Internal Data Bus / DaemonSet
- **Placement:** As a daemon/service monitoring internal message buses, logs, or storage endpoints.
- **Function:** Scans logs, message queues, or batch data for PII, then redacts before storage.
- **Advantages:**
  - Ideal for batch processing or logging systems.
  - Reduces risk of sensitive data in logs or backups.
- **Considerations:** Not real-time for API requests; better for secondary data flows.

## 3. Technology Stack
- Python microservice for PII detection and redaction.
- Integration via:
  - API Gateway: Kong, Nginx, or Envoy with custom plugins.
  - Sidecar: Lightweight container using FastAPI or Flask for traffic interception.
- Logging & monitoring: Prometheus/Grafana to track PII redaction stats.

## 4. Performance & Scalability Considerations
- **Latency:** Keep regex/NER operations optimized; use caching for repeated patterns.
- **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling of API gateway or sidecar containers based on traffic.
- **Cost-effectiveness:** Centralized API gateway deployment reduces per-service overhead.
- **Ease of Integration:** Minimal changes to existing applications; deploy as an intercepting layer.

## 5. Security & Compliance
- Ensure redacted PII cannot be reconstructed.
- Encrypt all sensitive payloads in transit.
- Periodic audits and updates of PII detection patterns to meet compliance standards (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).

## 6. Recommendation
Deploy as an **API Gateway plugin** for real-time detection and redaction across all services. Supplement with a **log-level DaemonSet** for monitoring historical or batch data. This hybrid approach ensures comprehensive PII defense with minimal latency impact and high scalability.
